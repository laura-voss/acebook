## Project Description

For the penultimate engineering project during Weeks 8 and 9 of the Makers Academy hybrid course, we were tasked with developing a [Facebook](https://en-gb.facebook.com/) clone, known as Acebook. Within a team of 7 developers we developed this version that we're proud to present.

## Technologies Used

- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) web framework for Node.js.
- [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) to reload the server automatically.
- [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) to render view templates.
- [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com) to model objects in MongoDB.
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org) for linting.
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for testing.
- [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for end-to-end testing.
- [CSS](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html) for styling of the webpages.

## How to run locally

### Install Node.js

1. Install Node Version Manager (NVM)
   ```
   brew install nvm
   ```
   Then follow the instructions to update your `~/.bash_profile`.
2. Open a new terminal
3. Install the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), currently `18.1.0`.
   ```
   nvm install 18
   ```

### Set up this project

1. Fork this repository
2. Rename this fork
3. Clone the fork to your local machine
4. Install Node.js dependencies
   ```
   npm install
   ```
5. Install an ESLint plugin for your editor. For example: [linter-eslint](https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-eslint) for Atom and installing the `ES Lint` 
6. Install MongoDB
   ```
   brew tap mongodb/brew
   brew install mongodb-community@5.0
   ```
   *Note:* If you see a message that says `If you need to have mongodb-community@5.0 first in your PATH, run:`, follow the instruction. Restart your terminal after this.
7. Start MongoDB
   ```
   brew services start mongodb-community@5.0
   ```

### Start

1. Start the server
   ```
   npm start
   ```
2. Browse to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

#### Start test server
The server must be running locally with test configuration for the
integration tests to pass.

```
npm run start:test
```

This starts the server on port `3030` and uses the `acebook_test` MongoDB database,
so that integration tests do not interact with the development server.

### Test
- Run all tests
  ```
  npm test
  ```
- Run a check
  ```bash
  npm run lint              # linter only
  npm run test:unit         # unit tests only
  npm run test:integration  # integration tests only
  ```

## Card wall

We used a [Trello](https://trello.com/b/jFmua5rj/lukeingforsuggestions) board to keep track of the features we want to implement. We organised tickets amongst the team and moved the tickets accordingly to demonstrate at what stage that feature's at (To do/In progress/In review etc.).
<br>

## Team approach

* Standups every morning at 10:00
* Retro at 5:30 every evening
* Pair programming throughout the whole project
* Regular check-ins with team members to make sure nobody was left behind
* Trello board for distributing work and staying on track

### Edge cases

* Sign up with invalid input
* Sign up with an already used email
* Sign in with invalid input
* Try to access timeline or profile page when logged out
<br>

## Future improvements

* User can see only friends' posts on the timeline
* User can like and respond to individual comments
